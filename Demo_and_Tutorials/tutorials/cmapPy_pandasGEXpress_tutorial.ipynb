    "### The .gct format \n",
    "\n",
    "![Sample GCT file](GCT_mockup.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The GCT file format, a tab-delimited text-based format pairing matrix expression values with row and column metadata, allowing comparison of both transcriptional and contextual differences across samples. A schematic of a sample GCT file is pictured above. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The .gctx format\n",
    "\n",
    "![Sample GCTX file](GCTX_mockup.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The GCTX file format was developed to improve serialization performance of GCT, particularly for large files. GCTX is an HDF5-based data format that can contain the same content as one or more GCT files in a hierarchically-structured, compressed, and easily accessible form (full file specification available at clue.io/code). Amongst other features, the HDF5 format allows users the ability to parse a subset of a large data set without reading the entire data set into memory first (using hyperslab selection). A schematic of a sample GCTX file is pictured above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The GCToo object \n",
    "\n",
    "`GCToo` objects are instances of the GCToo class we developed to represent .gct and .gctx files in a form compatible with Python's [PANDAS](http://pandas.pydata.org/) library. In essence, GCToo is a container of 3 pandas DataFrames (optionally, can also include a multi-index DataFrame of these 3 DataFrames combined) as well as two attributes representing the file source and version respectively. For more information, please see [our documentation](https://clue.io/cmapPy/pandasGEXpress.html#gctoo-class). "

    "A big reason why we wrote `pandasGEXpress` was to enable users to maximize their use of `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and other powerful and robustly-developed Python data science packages. Interacting with such tools simply requires referencing the relevant DataFrame attributes of your GCToo instance; here, we'll demonstrate how to do some basic arithmetic and grouping tasks on components of a GCToo instance. It should go without saying that the examples below are common but also fairly trivial examples of the wide functionality that libraries like pandas and sci-kit learn provide. \n",
